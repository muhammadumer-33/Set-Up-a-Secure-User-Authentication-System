**Platform:** Internee.pk  
**Student Name:** Muhammad Umer  
**Assignment No:** 3  
**Project Type:** Secure User Authentication System  

---

## 📌 Project Description

This project is a **secure user authentication system** developed as part of **Assignment 3** on **Internee.pk**.  
The system focuses on **strong authentication, data protection, and account security** using modern cybersecurity practices.

It includes:
- Password hashing
- Google Authenticator based Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- AES-256 encryption
- Secure session handling
- Fully animated Dracula-themed user interface

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Strengthen user authentication
- Protect sensitive user data
- Prevent unauthorized access
- Implement industry-standard security mechanisms
- Provide a professional and animated user interface

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python (Flask)** – Backend framework  
- **SQLite** – Database  
- **Google Authenticator** – Two-Factor Authentication (TOTP)  
- **AES-256 (Fernet)** – Encryption  
- **Flask-Login** – Session management  
- **HTML & CSS** – Frontend  
- **Dracula Theme** – Animated UI  

---

## 🔐 Security Features

### ✅ 1. Password Hashing
- Passwords are never stored in plain text
- Secure hashing is used before saving passwords

---

### ✅ 2. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- Implemented using **Google Authenticator**
- Uses **Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP)**
- Protects accounts even if passwords are compromised

**2FA Flow:**
1. User logs in with email and password  
2. System requests OTP  
3. OTP is generated by Google Authenticator  
4. OTP is verified  
5. Access is granted  

---

### ✅ 3. QR Code-Based 2FA Setup
- QR code generated during registration
- User scans QR code in Google Authenticator
- Secret key is securely stored

---

### ✅ 4. AES-256 Encryption
- 2FA secret keys are encrypted using **AES-256**
- Encryption key is persistent
- Prevents sensitive data exposure even if database is leaked

---

### ✅ 5. Secure Session Management
- Sessions managed using Flask-Login
- Protected routes require authentication
- Unauthorized users cannot access the dashboard

---

## 🧛‍♂️ User Interface Features

- Fully animated Dracula dark theme
- Neon glow effects
- Animated login and register forms
- Smooth transitions
- Cyber-security inspired dashboard
- Custom animated mouse cursor
